How adding the betting money and checking your hand works in Java fx
4/3/2020

With this program, you will be able to see how much money you win or lose from your hand choice.

To install the code you would need to make sure you have all the downloads for Javafx and use JDK8.

  As the code compiles, it will start to add the money of your standard 200. you will change the text of the 200 when the hand is a win hand. And you may still gain only 4 cards and i still have not fixed the issue, maybe you may find a soulltion for this issue. But as the prgram goes down it evaluates the cards you have and if your hand is the highest hand value thne you would change the value 
of the money the player earned which is double.
